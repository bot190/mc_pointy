# Description

Mc_Pointy is a tool for converting modded minecraft worlds between versions. This primarily consists of converting block IDs and NBT data from one set of info to another.

The primary goal of this utility is to bring a Minecraft 1.2.5 world up to date with Minecraft 1.13 while maintaining the mod setup we had.
